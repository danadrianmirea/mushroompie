"Dizzy" game engine for gameboy

Their main character was a funny egg who wears red boxing gloves and red 
boots. Dizzy's adventures started back in 1986, on ZX Spectrum, but kept 
it's fans over the years. You can read more about the Dizzy series on 
Wikipedia. 

For developing the engine I used the game "The Mushrooms Pie" which is an 
example of the DizzyAGE engine. 

DizzyAGE devtools contain the game engine, the map editor, a few tools and 
the default template with tiles, scrips and everything. It is developed
by Alexandru and Cristina Simion.
